            <h2>Introduction to the CISM Certification</h2>
            <p>The Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) certification, offered by ISACA, is a globally recognized credential for professionals who design, build, and manage enterprise information security programs. It confirms expertise in information security governance, risk management, and incident management.</p>

            <h3>Exam Format</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number of Questions:</strong> 150 multiple-choice questions</li>
                <li><strong>Exam Duration:</strong> 4 hours (240 minutes)</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Scaled score from 200 to 800. A passing score of 450 is required.</li>

        { q: "Evidence handling during a forensic investigation is critical to maintain the:", a: "Chain of custody.", o: ["Mean time to recover.", "Annualized loss expectancy.", "Security baseline."], r: "The chain of custody is a chronological documentation trail showing the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence. Breaking it can make the evidence inadmissible in court." },
        { q: "A user reports a suspicious email. The security team analyzes it and determines it is a phishing attempt. This process is part of which incident management phase?", a: "Detection and Analysis", o: ["Containment", "Recovery", "Preparation"], r: "This phase involves identifying potential incidents, analyzing the available data to confirm if it is a real incident, and determining its scope and severity." },
        { q: "An organization has defined that any incident resulting in data loss for more than 100 customers must be reported to the CEO within one hour. This is an example of an:", a: "Escalation procedure.", o: ["Eradication step.", "Recovery Time Objective (RTO).", "Asset classification policy."], r: "Escalation procedures define the thresholds and pathways for notifying higher levels of management as an incident's severity increases." }
