Data in RAM is highly volatile (it disappears on shutdown), while data on a hard drive is non-volatile. Forensics investigators must collect evidence in order from most to least volatile." },
                { question: "Which of the following should be a key goal of the post-incident review meeting?", answers: ["To assign blame for the incident", "To identify opportunities for improvement in a blame-free manner", "To calculate the exact financial cost of the incident", "To finalize the press release about the incident"], correct: 1, "explanation": "A successful lessons-learned session requires an environment of trust where people can speak openly about what went wrong without fear of punishment. The goal is process improvement, not assigning blame." },
                { question: "A reciprocal agreement for disaster recovery is generally considered risky PRIMARILY because:", answers: ["The other company might be a competitor", "It is difficult to enforce and the other company may not have resources available in a real disaster", "It is the most expensive type of alternate site", "It requires a full-time staff to maintain the agreement"], correct: 1, explanation: "Reciprocal agreements are often informal and hard to enforce. When a disaster strikes, the partner organization will be focused on its own survival and may not have the capacity or willingness to help, making it an unreliable option." },
                { question: "The first action an incident responder should take upon discovering a compromised system is to:", answers: ["Wipe the system and reinstall the OS", "Follow the procedures in the incident response plan", "Unplug the system from the network immediately", "Call the CEO"], correct: 1, explanation: "While unplugging the system might seem right, it could destroy volatile evidence. The correct first step is always to follow the pre-approved, documented procedures in the IRP, which will guide the responder on the proper steps for containment and evidence preservation." },
                { question: "The main output of a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a list of:", answers: ["All company employees and their contact information", "All potential security vulnerabilities", "Prioritized critical business processes and their recovery requirements (RTO/RPO)", "Approved hardware and software vendors"], correct: 2, explanation: "The BIA's core purpose is to identify what is most important to the business and how quickly it needs to be recovered after a disruption. This information is the foundation for the entire BCP/DR strategy." },
                { question: "What is the primary risk of not testing a disaster recovery plan?", answers: ["The plan will not receive approval from auditors", "The plan is likely to fail during a real disaster", "The company will not be able to get cybersecurity insurance", "Employees will not know the plan exists"], correct: 1, explanation: "A plan that has not been tested is just a collection of untested assumptions. Testing is the only way to find flaws in the plan and ensure the technology and people can perform as expected under pressure." },
                { question: "Which of the following is an example of an out-of-band communication method for an incident response team?", answers: ["The company's primary email system", "A conference call using the corporate VoIP phone system", "A group chat on a public social media platform", "A pre-established phone bridge hosted by a third-party provider"], correct: 3, explanation: "Out-of-band communication uses a channel that is separate from the company's primary, potentially compromised network. This ensures the team can communicate securely even if corporate email or phones are down." },
                { question: "The final step in a digital forensics process is typically:", answers: ["Evidence collection", "Analysis", "Presentation and reporting", "Containment"], correct: 2, explanation: "After evidence has been collected, preserved, and analyzed, the findings must be documented and presented in a clear, concise report that can be understood by management, legal teams, or a court." }
